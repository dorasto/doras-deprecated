# 🚀 Exciting Updates and Fixes Galore! 😎

Oh boy, guess what? We just had our first outage adventure, but fear not, we've bounced back stronger than ever! No more self-hosting shenanigans for our admin portal – now it's living its best life on Cloudflare Pages, zippier than a shooting star!

#### Your Story Magic 📖

Toggle that "Your Story" switch, and voila! Your story takes center stage, not some pesky error story from before. Smooth sailing, right?

#### Megaphone Menu Marvels ✅

Check out our revamped "megaphone menu" – it now magically displays the freshest Doras and admin portal versions. No need to visit the website; we bring the news to you!

#### Colors, Colors, Colors! 🎨

Custom colors are back with a vengeance! Say goodbye to dummy data; the predefined colors are now the real deal. Style your world with a splash of color!

#### Password Magic 🔑

Resetting your password just got a whole lot easier. No more hoops to jump through; we've streamlined the process, right from the login screen. Key to the kingdom, unlocked!

#### Text Block Tango 💬

The Text Block editor got a makeover! Goodbye, awkward design – hello, clarity! Dark mode is now sleeker, making your text area pop. Editing has never looked this good!

#### Payments Power-Up 🧑‍💻

Drumroll, please! The payment processor is in the house, and we've given it a thorough checkup. Doras Pro is on the horizon, and once it launches, you'll be diving in headfirst!

Big shoutout to all our amazing testers! The countdown to the public beta is on – expect it to drop before 2024! 🎉 Let's keep this ship sailing smoothly! ⛵
